This project was centered around using AES encryption standards, creating a checksum, generating ssl certificate, and doing vulnerability scans.

Artemis Financial Vulnerability Assessment Report Summary:
Artemis Financial is a client that required a thorough assessment of their software to identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities. The company is focused on financial services, where data security is paramount. They wanted to ensure that their software met the highest security standards to protect sensitive financial information from potential threats.

Key Accomplishments:
In conducting the vulnerability assessment, I was able to thoroughly analyze the existing codebase and identify several critical security vulnerabilities, such as outdated encryption methods and insecure data handling practices. The refactoring process involved implementing secure coding practices, including the use of the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) cipher to enhance data security. Coding securely is essential because it safeguards against breaches, protects sensitive information, and upholds the company’s reputation, which is vital in the financial industry. Strong software security is integral to maintaining customer trust and ensuring compliance with industry regulations.

Challenges and Insights:
One challenging aspect of the vulnerability assessment was ensuring that all identified vulnerabilities were addressed without introducing new issues. This required careful analysis and testing after each refactor. To verify that the code was both functional and secure, I employed a combination of static code analysis tools and manual testing. This approach allowed me to ensure that the refactored code did not introduce any new vulnerabilities and that the system remained stable and secure.

Increasing Security Layers:
To increase security, I implemented multiple layers of protection, such as stronger encryption, input validation, and secure communication protocols. In the future, I would utilize comprehensive security frameworks like OWASP’s dependency-check and consider using automated penetration testing tools to further assess vulnerabilities. These tools help prioritize which vulnerabilities to address based on severity, allowing for more effective mitigation.

Ensuring Functionality and Security:
To ensure that the refactored code remained functional and secure, I performed thorough testing, including regression testing and security-focused tests. I also reviewed the code to ensure that no new vulnerabilities were introduced during the refactor. Using version control tools like Git was helpful in tracking changes and ensuring that any issues could be quickly identified and resolved.

Resources and Future Use:
The resources and tools I used, such as static code analysis tools, secure coding guidelines, and encryption libraries, will be invaluable in future assignments. These practices help ensure that software is developed with security in mind from the outset, reducing the risk of vulnerabilities.

Portfolio Artifact for Future Employers:
The Artemis Financial Vulnerability Assessment Report showcases my ability to identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities, which is a critical skill in software development. I would present this artifact to future employers to demonstrate my expertise in secure coding practices, my ability to conduct comprehensive vulnerability assessments, and my commitment to maintaining the security and integrity of software systems.
